# messageMonster

A central messaging service to automatically send and receive network status messages and reports to various groups and users in the corporate.
  
  The application will be based on a python app that accesses various servers and services to send out notifications.
  It will also allow users to send messages to other users and groups.
  The messages will be sent using old fashioned email and something from the 21st century called MQTT.
  Reports will be generated and delivered and different formats depending on their role, PM, TL, IT Admin, CEO etc.
  AI will be used to read the status report and turn it into a user friendly summary for management who don't know jack.
  The messages and status will also be displayed on a webserver in realtime.
  IT Admins will be able send command messages to the script such as BACKUP_DB_ONE, RESTART_WEBSERVER_2 etc from their phones while down the pub.
  
  All code will be clean lean and follow best practices.
  
  Hows that for a starter.

  Lets create a monster!
